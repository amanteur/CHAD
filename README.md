## Abstract
Query-by-Humming (QbH) is a task that involves finding the most relevant song based on a hummed or sung fragment. Despite recent successful commercial solutions, implementing QbH systems remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets for training machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce Covers and Hummings Aligned Dataset (CHAD), a novel dataset that contains 18 hours of short music fragments, paired with time-aligned hummed versions. To expand our dataset, we employ a semi-supervised model training pipeline that leverages the QbH task as a specialized case of cover song identification (CSI) task. Starting with a model trained on the initial dataset, we iteratively collect groups of fragments of cover versions of the same song and retrain the model on the extended data. Using this pipeline, we collect over 308 hours of additional music fragments, paired with time-aligned cover versions. The final model is successfully applied to the QbH task and achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets. Our study shows that the proposed dataset and training pipeline can effectively facilitate the implementation of QbH systems.
